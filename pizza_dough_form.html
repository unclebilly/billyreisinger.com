    How to Create a Pizza Crust from a Dough Ball
  </h2>
  <p>
    This soundless movie details how a pizza dough ball can be shaped out by hand.
    The crust is formed by flattening the chilled dough ball and turning at the same time in a clockwise motion.
    The flattened result is then placed on a screen to prepare for toppings.
