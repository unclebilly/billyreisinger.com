<div class="container">
  <p>
    I enjoy programming software and managing computers, and I have been doing so since 2002. I am skilled with many of the technologies that power web applications: Linux systems, databases, web applications, and web user interfaces.  In other words, I'm a full-stack engineer. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I thrive on solving complex problems, designing simple solutions, and working in a team.
    I believe that effective, timely, and respectful communication is a key component of every successful software team.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am a <strong>strong</strong> believer in
    <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development'>Test-Driven Development</a>.  I am well versed in 
    <a href='http://agilemanifesto.org/'>Agile Development</a>
    practices, and I
    <a href='https://github.com/unclebilly'>participate actively</a>
    in the open source community.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lastly, I think that having a <a href="http://github.com/unclebilly/logpoop">sense of humor</a> about stuff helps you not die.
