<div class="container">
  <p>
    I enjoy programming software and managing computers, and I have been doing so since 2002. I am skilled with many of the technologies that power web applications: Linux systems, databases, web applications, and web user interfaces.  In other words, I'm a full-stack engineer. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I thrive on solving complex problems, designing simple solutions, and working in a team.
    I believe that effective, timely, and respectful communication is a salient trait of every successful software team.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm an experienced technology leader with a track record of guiding difficult projects
    to successful completion.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am a <strong>strong</strong> believer in
    <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development'>Test-Driven Development</a>.  I am well versed in 
    <a href='http://agilemanifesto.org/'>Agile Development</a>
    practices, and I
    <a href='https://github.com/unclebilly'>participate actively</a>
    in the open source community.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lastly, I think that having a <a href="http://github.com/unclebilly/logpoop">sense of humor</a> about stuff helps you not die.

  <h2>Experience</h2>
  <b>Director of Software Engineering</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href='https://granicus.com'>Granicus</a>, St. Paul, MN (November 2016 - present)
  <p>As the Director of Software Engineering for Granicus' Twin Cities office, I directly manage a team of about 25 engineers.  My duties include people management, employee career development, technical triage, and strategic and tactical technology planning and execution. </p>
  <b>Software Architect</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href='http://govdelivery.com'>GovDelivery</a>, St. Paul, MN (April 2014 - November 2016)
  <p>
    As a Software Architect at GovDelivery, I was not only one of the people responsible for software architecture, but also made individual contributions in applications and served as a team lead on several Scrum teams (not all at once).  I was also tasked with mentoring other engineers and promoting the greater team's values - TDD, collective ownership, etc.
  </p>
  <b>Senior Software Engineer</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href='http://govdelivery.com'>GovDelivery</a>, St. Paul, MN (January 2009 - March 2014)
  <p>
    As Senior Software Engineer, I was part of a small team that successfully rewrote GovDelivery's legacy system into a modern, test-driven application. I also helped to design and plan several new applications, including a transactional messaging service and a high-volume analytics application. I worked in a small team that established devops as an engineering team-wide practice while overcoming cultural resistance and establishing devops practices as normal workflows. Finally, I created a few open source projects in the company's name and made some major contributions to popular open source projects directly related to Granicus technology.

  <b>Senior Web Developer</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href='http://www.ibsys.com'>Internet Broadcasting Systems</a>, Minneapolis, MN (December, 2005 - December, 2008)
  <p>
    As a Senior Develoer at InternetBroadcasting, I primarily worked with JavaScript, ActionScript/Flex, Ruby, MySQL, and XSLT. I served as a development team lead during a crucial website relaunch for a high-profile, demanding customer. Later I worked as a developer on a cross-functional team to create a greenfield application related to local news.
