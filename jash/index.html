	<p>
		Jash is a DHTML-based window that gives you command-line 
		JavaScript access to the current browser window.  With this 
		console you can quickly debug scripts, manipulate the DOM, 
		view the current page's objects, functions, and variables, 
		execute arbitrary Javascript, 
		enter new CSS (in IE, Firefox, Opera, and Safari), and much more.

	<h2>How does it work?</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Jash is simply made up of JavaScript and CSS. There is 
			no need to install a plugin or change the way you use
			other tools, like Firebug or Fiddler.
		</li>
		<li>
			Jash can be included in a web page's html through a single 
			script tag, or it can be loaded through the use of a bookmarklet 
			(see <a href="download.html">the download page</a>). 
		</li>
		<li>
			Jash is loaded onto the page as a single object named <i>Jash</i>, 
			and all of its members are contained within that namespace. 
			This effectively eliminates namespace collisions, unless 
			of course you happen to have an object named "Jash" 
			in the window you are working on.
		</li>
		<li>
			For maximum portability and compatibility, Jash is not 
			reliant on any framework (such as Prototype or Dojo). 
		</li>
	</ul>
