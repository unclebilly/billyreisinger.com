<h4>Description</h4>
          <p>We had tons of success with <a href="/pizzas/37_kale_sweet_potato_red_onion_and_garlicinf.html">our last pizza with kale</a>, and we had a ton of it from one of our generous friends.  So, we decided to try to repeat the success, but with different ingredients.  This time, I layered the kale on the bottom (after briefly dowsing it with balsamic vinegar), put some mozzarella on top, and then added thinly-sliced tomatoes and halved kalamata olives. Then I topped the affair with sprinkles of feta cheese.  Fantastic!</p>
