<h4>Description</h4>
          <p>Yeah, this pizza was good. I took the leftovers to work - that was really a good pick-me-up. I love the smell of the fresh basil combined with the roasted red peppers - it reminds me of when I used to work in a pizza kitchen. We got the basil, chicken, red onion, and green pepper at the local farmer's market. I could be imagining things, but it always seems like the produce there just tastes better than the store-bought stuff.</p>
