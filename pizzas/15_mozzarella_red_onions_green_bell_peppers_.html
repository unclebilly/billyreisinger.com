<h4>Description</h4>
          <p>Ah, it is not often I get to enjoy pepperoni on my pizza. This was a treat! We invited Jen's parents over for dinner, and that was my excuse to buy some nice pepperoni for this pizza. Needless to say, this was a classic pizza. Definitely good re-heated as well. I was glad that there were leftovers - hell yeah!</p>
