<h4>Description</h4>
  <p>This was an ok pizza - not the best. It was very greasy for some reason - I suspect it was a combination of the goat cheese, mozzarella, and ham. I used a very low-quality pre-cut, packaged ham for this pizza, and I'm sorry I did that. Next time I will use a deli ham or Canadian bacon. Or maybe even prosciutto...</p>
