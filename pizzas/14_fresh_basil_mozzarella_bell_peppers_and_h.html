<h4>Description</h4>
  <p>This pizza was straight from the farmers market. I guess we had so much stuff from there we needed to eat it somehow. We didn't even plan on having pizza, it just kind of happened. I sincerely enjoyed the tartness of the red tomatoes and how they contrasted with the sweet, buttery flavor of the yellow tomato. In combination with fresh basil and green bell pepper, this was a pretty good pizza.</p>
