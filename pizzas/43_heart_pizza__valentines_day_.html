<h4>Description</h4>
          <p>I made this pizza for Valentine's Day for my wife and son.  One half had her favorite ingredients, and the other half had my son's favorite.  I was happy eating either - I'm not picky when it comes to pizza.  To make the heart shape, I shaped the dough into a circle (as if I was making a regular pizza) and used a pizza cutter to cut a heart shape out of the dough.  Then, I put it on the screen and put toppings on it as I would with a normal, circular pizza.</p>
