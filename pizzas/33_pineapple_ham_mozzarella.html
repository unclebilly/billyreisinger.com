<h4>Description</h4>
          <p>Wow, this one was good. I made this while Jennifer was out of town, because she does not like ham. There are two approaches to putting ham on a pizza - putting it under the cheese or on top of the cheese. Putting it on top yields ham that is a little crispy on the edges, which is yummy. In this case, I put the ham under the cheese - which kept the ham from drying out in the oven.</p>
