<h4>Description</h4>
  <p>This was a fairly decent pizza. It was a little on the greasy side. It is possible to put too much garlic butter on, and I think that's what happened with this one. Regardless, this is a fantastic topping combination. I remember the leftovers from this one being pretty good.</p>
