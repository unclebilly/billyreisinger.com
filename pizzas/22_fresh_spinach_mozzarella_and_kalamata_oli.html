<h4>Description</h4>
          <p>After the last strange pizza, Jennifer and I were looking for something a little more down-to-earth. This pizza was a welcome change from the apricot weirdness from last time. We both love kalamata olives. I can't stress enough how much better they are than those plain old green or black olives you get in a can. But of course, they are a little pricey.</p>
