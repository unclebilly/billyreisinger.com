<h4>Description</h4>
          <p>We had some friends over for pizzas, and they brought some fresh kale from their garden.  I didn't know what to do with it, so I pulled this recipe from <a href="http://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/sweet-potato-kale-pizza-with-rosemary-red-onion/">Two Peas And Their Pod</a>, which I found after searching for "kale pizza."  It was definitely a hit!  I ended up roasting some garlic cloves in olive oil, and using that oil to baste the pizza before putting the toppings on.</p>
