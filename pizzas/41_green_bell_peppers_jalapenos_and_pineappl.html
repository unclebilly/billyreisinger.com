<h4>Description</h4>
          <p>This was a small pizza that I made on a stone.  I used a pizza stone with this pizza, and the oven spring from the stone was quite apparent.  You don't get that nice, fluffy rise from the screen, I will admit.  This is a fantastic combination of ingredients - one that we seem to come back to time and again.</p>
