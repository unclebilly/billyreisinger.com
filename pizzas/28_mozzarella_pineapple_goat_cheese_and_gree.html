<h4>Description</h4>
  <p>Yet another of the same. The crust came out pretty good on this one - the bottom was nice and crispy, and the crust was chewy and tasty in general. We used some of that generic mozzarella, which is really not that tasty - at least not as tasty as real, fresh mozzarella. Whatever, the pizza was still good.</p>
