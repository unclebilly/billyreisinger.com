<h4>Description</h4>
  <p>This pizza was a hybrid of grilled chicken, pickled jalapeños, diced tomatoes, pepperoni, and garlic butter.  To make the toppings, we first grilled a chicken breast.  Next, we shredded the chicken and tossed it in a bowl with barbecue sauce.  Then, we topped the pizza with garlic butter and cheese, spread the chicken, jalapeños, tomatoes on three-quarters of the pizza.  We put pepperoni slices on the other quarter of the pizza for our young child, who would not have enjoyed our part of the pizza.  This one was really good!</p>
