<h4>Description</h4>
          <p>Another pizza where we enjoyed fresh ingredients from the farmer's market. We already had a freeze here, so it's likely that were not going to see much more life at the market. We're enjoying it while we can! I used regular flour for this pizza (I usually use bread flour or whole wheat flour) and I was pleased with the change. I really, really kneaded the dough this time; I'm sure that has something to do with why the dough came out so well. I also let the crust sit out and rise for about an hour after shaping it, and the final result was a light, airy pizza crust that was pleasantly crisp on the bottom yet chewy throughout. Mmmm.....</p>
