<h4>Description</h4>
          <p>I used whole wheat dough on the last pie I made, and it was delicious. You can't go wrong with a Pizza Margarita - though I used a marinara instead of fresh Roma tomatoes. Whatever, it was ridiculously good. The cheese was a bit runny; next time I'll use a firmer one. The fresh mozzarella I had picked out was a little on the squishy side, and when it melted and combined with the sauce, the pizza was kinda drippy. In the picture, you can see lighter spots where the cheese was sitting on top of basil leaves and couldn't mix with the sauce. That's how runny it was.</p>
