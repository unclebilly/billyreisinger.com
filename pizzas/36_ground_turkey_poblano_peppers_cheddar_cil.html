<h4>Description</h4>
  <p>This pizza had a quarter section which was just pepperoni and cheese - for our young child.  The other portion had a garlic butter sauce, in which I minced up about a teaspoon of cilantro stems.  Then, I put a mix of cheddar and mozzarella cheese on it.  I added some ground turkey, which I had pre-cooked and seasoned with cumin, paprika, salt, and black pepper.  I also added some poblano peppers that I roasted, peeled, and diced.  The last ingredient was a diced tomato.</p>
