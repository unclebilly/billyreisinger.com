<h4>Description</h4>
  <p>This pizza was pretty good. I used a different kind of yeast for this one (Red Star) because the store was out of the kind I like (Fleischmanns). I'm not a big fan of Red Star yeast; it just doesn't impart any flavor. Not that Fleischmanns has tons of flavor, but at least it has some. Also, the dough was a little flat, though I don't really care about that. Portabellas are great on pizza - they have that wonderful musky taste that really adds a depth of flavor unique to them. They are complemented well by tomatoes, goat cheese, feta, artichoke hearts, Italian sausage, and many other common pizza toppings. I chose vine-ripened tomatoes for this particular pizza. This pizza turned out exceptionally well. Two thumbs up from Jen.</p>
