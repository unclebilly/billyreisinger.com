<h4>Description</h4>
          <p>If this sounds like one of those pizzas that might be gross but is actually really good, it's not. I was trying to emulate a frozen pizza that Trader Joe's sells, but this was nowhere near as good. In fact, it was downright weird. I was not a big fan of it at all. What went wrong? I'm not sure. The apricot sauce was really just apricot jam - maybe that was the first mistake. It was much too sweet. The flavors just didn't blend together like I thought they would. But hey! At least I tried, right?</p>
