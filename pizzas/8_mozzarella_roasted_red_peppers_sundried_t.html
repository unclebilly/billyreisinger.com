<h4>Description</h4>
          <p>I opted for a thinner crust on this pizza, using about 3/4 of the volume of a normal dough ball for the same size pizza. Jennifer liked this one a lot. She said it was the best one I have ever made. She's said that a few times, so either I am getting better at this, or she has a short memory. I think the former is true and not the latter (she remembers everything).</p>
