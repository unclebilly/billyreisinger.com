<h4>Description</h4>
          <p>Actually, the sauteed onions were only on half of the pizza, as Jen doesn't like onions particularly. This was one of those "what do I have in the kitchen to make a pizza?" pizzas. We really didn't plan the ingredients. Surprisingly, the crust on this one was fabulous. Here's a tip: always rehydrate sun-dried tomatoes before putting them on your pizza. Soak them in hot water for ten minutes and then drain. Additionally, make sure you put them underneath any other toppings - unless you like the texture of leather on your pizza.</p>
