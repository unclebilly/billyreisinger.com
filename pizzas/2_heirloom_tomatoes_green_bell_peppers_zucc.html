<h4>Description</h4>
  <p>We had some friends over for dinner, and we wanted to have a "top your own pizza" party. I got a bunch of ingredients ready, and prepared the pizza dough with garlic butter and cheese ahead of time - when our friends came, they brought some of their garden veggies for us to use, too.  The result was 2 pizzas that had tons of different things on them.  We had lots of fun, and the food was great!</p>
