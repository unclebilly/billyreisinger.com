<h4>Description</h4>
          <p>Half of this pizza was for Jen's Grandmother Marie. She loves cheeze pizza, plain and simple. Jen, on the other hand, likes veggies a lot. I'm not crazy about artichokes, but we had some left over from some other dinner and Jen wanted them on her half. To each one's own.</p>
