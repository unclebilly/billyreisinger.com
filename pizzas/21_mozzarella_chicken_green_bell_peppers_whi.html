<h4>Description</h4>
          <p>This was an amazingly delicious pizza. It was Jen's idea to use this topping combination. We used Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce, which is our favorite. Then I seared a chicken breast on the stove until it was just barely cooked enough, cut it in thin slices, and slapped it on with thinly-sliced green bell pepper and thick-cut chunks of white onions. Mmmmm! I'm getting misty thinking about this one again. I've taken to mixing about half bread flour with half whole wheat flour - I feel like I'm getting nicer, stretchier dough with the higher gluten in the bread flour, but retaining the wonderful taste of the whole wheat.</p>
