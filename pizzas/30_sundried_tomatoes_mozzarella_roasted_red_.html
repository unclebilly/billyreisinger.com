<h4>Description</h4>
  <p>Don't touch my pizza with any other olive than a kalamata. I like to buy the kind that haven't been pitted, because you can save a few bucks that way. You have to do a little more work to prep the olives, though. Always hydrate sun-dried tomatoes first, and always put them under the cheese, to avoid burning them or drying them out. No one likes leathery or burned sundried tomatoes. This pizza turned out exceptionally well. Two thumbs up from Jen.</p>
