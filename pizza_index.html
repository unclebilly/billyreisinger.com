    Welcome to the amateur guide to making your own pizza on the internet.
    This guide has been delivering questionable pizza advice
    <a href='http://web.archive.org/web/20050706101714/http://www.billyreisinger.com/pizza.php'>since 2005</a>.

    I'm an average guy who started making pizza in a restaurant chain when I was 16 years old.  I later
    worked as a cook several different restaurants, mostly in gourmet Mexican food establishments in San Antonio, Texas
    and New Orleans, Louisiana.  In New Orleans, while I attended college, I worked as a cook and and manager at a gourmet pizza restaurant.
    After graduating and moving on, I started making pizza at home, using techniques that I had learned at the many kitchens
    and from the many amazing people that I had met along the way.

    Since I put this site on the Internet in 2005, I have received many emails from people all over the world. Some have asked me practical questions
    about making pizza at home.  Other people wanted simply to thank me for the recipe and (questionable) advice.  Various people
    have sent me pictures of the pizzas that they made after reading my site (which is always an ego boost).  Still others
    took time to correct or criticize information that I've presented on the site.  I appreciate every single
    email I've gotten, and I've learned many things about making pizza because of them.  If you want to send me a note, my
    email address is
    <a href='mailto:billy.reisinger@gmail.com'>billy.reisinger@gmail.com</a>.
