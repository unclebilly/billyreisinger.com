    There are a few "secrets of the trade" in making
    your own pizza; once you know them, it is not hard to
    make your own and it takes very little time.
    In fact, after you make it a few times you'll wonder
    why I made such a big deal out of it.

    The instructions below are for making a pizza
    in the traditional American pizzeria style.  The intended audience for this guide
    is the amateur home cook with little to no experience making pizza and possibly no
    equipment to do so.

  <ul>
    <li>
      You will need a
      <b>large, flat surface</b>
      that you can get messy, and you will
      need a large (large!) bowl. Also, you
      <em>will</em>
      make
      a mess the first few times you do this.
    </li>
    <li>
      Making pizza is much easier with a
      <b>pizza paddle</b>.
      With a paddle, you can get your
      pizza in and out of the oven easily without burning yourself or losing your pizza.  Also,
      it makes the job of putting a topped, raw pizza onto a pizza stone much easier.
    </li>
    <li>
      With my pizzas, I prefer to use a
      <a href='http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=pizza+screen' title='Amazon.com sells many different kinds of pizza screens'>
        pizza screen
      </a>.
      There is no question that a pizza cooked on a stone comes out lighter, springier, and
      with a generally better crust.
      The reason I prefer a screen is that pizza stones are not amateur-friendly. Here's why:
      <ol>
        <li>
          A screen won't shatter if I drop it on the floor
          or heat it improperly, like a pizza stone.
        </li>
        <li>
          When I accidentally get certain foods on a stone - such as pepperoni - the stone will smoke and
          smell bad every time I use it again.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is tough to master the maneuver necessary for getting a topped, raw pizza off
          of a paddle and onto a stone.  The first few times I did it, I ended up flinging toppings all over
          the place and stretching out the dough on accident.
        </li>
        <li>
          A "good screen" is an order of magnitude cheaper than a "good stone." Of course, I
          could use unglazed ceramic tiles (which are cheap), but because they don't come in
          a size big enough for a good pizza, I'd have to put a few of them together.  That's a
          bad situation because they tend to move around when I try to put a topped pizza
          on them.
        </li>
        <li>
          With the
          <a href='/pizza_dough.html'>pizza dough</a>
          recipe that I use, nothing sticks to the screen (as long as I
          don't have any big holes in my dough).
        </li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      I actually have a stone and I use it at home on occasion.  I would not
      recommend a stone to somebody when they are making a pizza for the first time
      and they had never used a stone before.  If that sounds like you, consider buying a pizza screen.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3><a name='make'></a>Make the dough
  </h3>
  <p>
    Making the dough is complicated enough that it deserves its own page.  See
    <a href='pizza_dough.html' style='font-weight: bold'>How to Make Pizza Dough</a>,
    which has
    detailed instructions on how to make the pizza dough.  This step
    will take between 15 to 30 minutes.
  </p>
  <h3><a name='prepare'></a>Prepare toppings while the dough rises
  </h3>
  <div class='caption floatRight'>

    <div>Roasted garlic, zucchini, and parsley butter on wheat crust</div>
  </div>
  <p>
    At this point, you should use the dough rising time to
    slice, dice, and pre-cook any ingredients that you are going to
    put on the pizza.  It is important that you pre-cook any meats
    that would not be safe to eat raw before you put them on a pizza.  These
    meats include (but are not limited to) beef, sausage, chicken, and pork.
    This is also a good time to cook any tough vegetables, such as
    asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower, or eggplant.  Basically, get everything
    ready to go so that when you have the crust shaped out, you can just slap
    it on and throw it in the oven.
  </p>
  <h3><a name='shape'></a>Shape dough into pizza
  </h3>
  <p>
    This is the part that requires the most practice. The process can be
    broken down into a few steps, though they are not quite linear, unforutnately.
    Still, you should try them in the order below, and go to a
    previous or later step if required.
  </p>
  <p>
    The basic goal here is to form the dough into a flat circle (or square) that
    is about the same size as your cooking vessel.
  </p>
  <div class='floatRight'>
    <iframe allowfullscreen='' frameborder='0' height='260px' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/ERAIP0aZsj0' width='100%'></iframe>
  </div>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Dust your working surface with a thin layer of flour or
      corn meal (corn meal is best).  You may need to dust again if
      your dough sticks to the surface in the following steps.
    </li>
    <li>
      Grab a chilled dough ball and smash it out evenly with your palms
      (I use one on top of another, with my body weight behind them) to
      make the ball about twice the diameter it was.
    </li>
    <li>
      Pick up the dough and hold it between the palm
      and fingers of your preferred hand, letting the rest of the dough
      dangle and stretch down.  Now smash the edge of the dough with
      that hand while you gently pull the dough counter-clockwise
      with the other. Rotate the dough clockwise and repeat.  One
      step of this process should take you about a second.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once you have rotated the entire ball in your hands twice or three times,
      the ball should look like a small flying saucer - flat on the edges,
      and a little more spherical towards the middle.  Place
      the dough on your surface and smash it down with your palms (one on top
      of the other) until you have a more uniform shape.
    </li>
    <li>
      At this
      point, you need to stretch out the dough evenly into a larger size.
      You may need to add more flour or corn meal to your surface, because it is important that the dough
      moves without any friction. Place your palms a few inches apart on the top half of the dough about
      halfway between the center and the edge. Start rotating the dough on your surface, pulling with
      your palms in opposite directions. Make sure you pull gently; however, if you pull a hole
      in the dough, don't panic - just grab one side of the tear and pull it on top of the other, then
      smash it to "glue" the pieces together.  After you make one pull, rotate the dough clockwise
      about 1/8 turn and repeat. Make sure that you don't concentrate on one area too much -
      stretch both the middle and edge out evenly; however, only work on the top half of the dough.
    </li>
    <li>
      You can continue to shape the dough into the right size through the
      method immediately above, or you can be adventurous and try to
      <span style='font-weight: bolder'>toss the dough</span>.
      Tossing the dough is a quick way to stretch out the dough, using the inertial force
      of the spinning dough (sometimes referred to as centrifugal force) to stretch itself
      while it spins above you.  Tossing is a bit tricky, though, and can end in disaster
      in two ways:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Huge hole forms in the dough because you spin it too hard or
          you puncture it when catching it (not so bad)
        </li>
        <li>You don't catch the dough, and it lands somewhere gross, like the floor (BAD)</li>
      </ol>
      Needless to say, tossing takes practice.  This is not to say that you won't pick it up
      on the first try - some people just have a knack for this.  I've attempted to describe how
      I do it below.  Please remember, though, that the basic idea is to spin the dough up in the air,
      and that you may find a better way to do it yourself.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Hold the dough with the tips of the fingers of your left hand and
          the palm and fingertips of your right hand (or vice-versa if left-handed),
          in such a way that most of the dough spills over
          between you and your hands.
        </li>
        <li>
          You will spin the dough counter-clockwise if you are right handed; clockwise
          if you are left-handed. Before you toss, reverse spin about 1/4 turn - then gently but
          quickly spin the dough and toss it up in the air simultaneously.  Catch the
          dough with as much "hand real estate" as possible - I go to the length of using my forearm -
          to avoid puncturing it.
        </li>
        <li>Repeat as necessary until the dough has stretched to the desired diameter.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

    <span style='font-weight: bolder'>
      Before you top your pizza, make sure that you have placed
      the dough on top of the screen
    </span>
    or stone.  You'll never get it on if you put toppings on first! Even if you
    have preheated your stone, you should take it out of the oven and put the dough on top before you top
    it. [Note: if you happen to have one of those huge pizza paddles, you can top the dough on your counter top
    and then slide it on the stone afterwards - just make sure you have plenty of cornmeal underneath the crust
    first. Be careful about throwing toppings into your oven, though.]
  </p>
  <p>
    Now is a great time to preheat the oven - I usually crank it up to the highest temperature
    before "broil", which on my oven is 500F.  I've found that it takes
    about 20 minutes for the oven to preheat to that temperature.
  </p>
  <p>
    This step is, by far, the one most rife with pizza pitfalls.
    We are cooking fast, and we are cooking at a high temperature - this
    means that there are two things to worry about: uneven cooking and
    burning.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Avoid uneven cooking
      <ul>
        <li>
          Spread your toppings evenly over the surface of
          the pizza, avoiding any "mountains."  Avoid piling up toppings
          in the center - pizza rookies
          tend to make this mistake, with disastrously undercooked
          results!  Don't be afraid
          to push the toppings as close to the edge of the crust
          as possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          As mentioned before, pre-cook any ingredients
          that may not be cooked thoroughly in 10 or so minutes
          of 500F heat.  This includes raw sausage, chicken, thick cuts of
          certain vegetables (such as eggplant), and beef.  Some
          people also prefer to pre-cook onions that have
          been cut in thick chunks.
        </li>
        <li>
          Every 3 to 4 minutes, check on your pizza by peeking through
          the window (but avoid opening the oven door so the oven doesn't
          lose heat).  If one side
          of the edge of the crust is browning, and another is not,
          this is a sure sign of uneven heat in your oven - twist the
          dough 1/2 turn.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don't put too many toppings on your pizza.  If the height of your pizza
          reaches more than an inch or so, you've probably got too much stuff
          on it, and the toppings buried way down on the bottom (not to mention
          the cheese) may not heat up.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Avoid burning
      <ul>
        <li>
          There are certain ingredients that must be
          <span style='font-weight: bold'>
            underneath cheese or other
            ingredients
          </span>
          if you don't like them black and crispy:
          <ul>
            <li>Spinach (GROSS when burned!)</li>
            <li>Fresh basil leaves (also gross if burned)</li>
            <li>Ham, Canadian bacon, prosciutto</li>
            <li>
              Pepperoni, salami (though some like
              them burned or crispy)
            </li>
            <li>Minced or chopped garlic</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Use a cheese or blend of cheeses with low moisture.
          Avoid cheeses with a low melting point (such as
          cheddar, American, and Monterrey Jack) and
          <span style='font-weight: bold'>
            absolutely
            do not touch your pizza with Velveeta
          </span>.
          Mozzarella and
          provolone are always good on pizza.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    After you
    add your toppings, slide the pizza into your oven, and enjoy the wonderful smell
    that will emanate from your kitchen.
  </p>
  <p>
    When your pizza appears to be done (for me, this usually means that the cheese on top has
    browned and the crust is nearly burned), take it out of the oven and place
    it somewhere safe, like a stove burner or wooden cutting board, to cool down.  Let it cool down at least a few minutes
    before you cut it.  All in all, a pizza should cook in about
    <span style='font-weight: bold'>
      10
      minutes
    </span>.
    Again, use your
    judgment and taste to decide when it is done; however, if it takes considerably
    longer than 10 minutes, you probably need to turn up the temperature on the oven.
  </p>
  <h3><a name='cut'></a>Cut it and eat it!
  </h3>
  <p>
    Some people prefer to use a pizza-cutter (one of those circular blades with a handle) to
    cut pizza; I find that one can rarely put the right amount of force behind the blade
    of a pizza-cutter.  I prefer to use a large chef knife (as in an 10" knife) to cut
    my pizzas at home.  In restaurants, I have seen all kinds of great gadgets to cut pizza - the best
    is the
    <a href='http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=pizza+rocker'>
      pizza
      rocker knife
    </a>.
    It might be a little over-the-top if you are not an avid pizza maker,
    but let me tell you - if you ever have to cut more than 3 pizzas at once, you'll thank
    me for this baby.  Even if you cut just one, you'll understand the value of this clever
    knife.
  </p>
  <p><span style='font-weight: bold'>If you do plan to use a pizza-cutter</span>,
    you should try to use the "lift and cut" method.  In
    other words, don't just drag the cutter over the pizza - you'll end up taking all of the
    toppings with it off the edge of the pizza!  You should firmly push the cutter down on the crust, move
    it back and forth about an inch, and repeat until you have cut the entire pizza.
  </p>
  <p>
    After cutting the pizza, you can sprinkle some Parmesan or Romano cheese and
    a little chopped parsley on top.  Finally, enjoy your beautiful and tasty pizza!
