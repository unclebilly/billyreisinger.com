    Tips for Making Great Pizza
  </h2>
  <h3>Choosing Flour and Yeast</h3>
  <p>
    I don't need to tell you about the good toppings
    that you should be putting on your pizza. Fresh ingredients
    almost always taste better - fresh basil, fresh tomato sauce,
    fresh mozzarella, etc.  On the other hand, you may be a bit
    confused about what type of flour to use, and where to find the
    kind of yeast to make a good pizza.
  </p>
  <h4>The Flour</h4>
  <p>
    Don't go out to the store and blow a wad of cash on some
    primo expensive flour if you can help it.  I have had great luck
    making pizza with all kinds of flours, though I most commonly use
    three types:
  </p>
  <div class='tip'>
    You can increase the flavor imparted by your yeast by chilling your dough overnight.
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>Unbleached bread flour</li>
    <li>Unbleached, all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>Whole wheat flour</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Out of the three, I've had the most success with unbleached bread flour.
    I find that bread flour yields a chewier crust and is easier to work with
    by hand when kneading.  When I use whole wheat flour, I don't make the whole
    crust with it - usually I use half whole wheat and half bread flour.
  </p>
  <h4>The Yeast</h4>
  <p>
    I regularly use Fleischmann's Yeast (the active dry kind,
    not the rapid-rise stuff).  It's convenient, and it is always
    active, even well beyond the expiration date.  I also like the flavor of
    Fleischmann's yeast compared to other brands.  Starting your own yeast
    culture is apparently easy and very rewarding, flavor-wise - but it still
    sounds like a lot of work for an amateur like me, who has tons of other stuff
    to do.
  </p>


  <h3>Let the Yeast Rest</h3>
  <p>
    After you have proofed your yeast to insure that it is viable,
    you should mix about half the flour mixture into the yeast
    / water mixture and let that combination sit out in a warm
    place for at least 15 minutes.  This allows the yeast to
    begin breaking down the flour before kneading the dough into
    a tougher, starchier consistency.  The result is better
    flavor and much better texture in the final product.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your mixture should be somewhat liquid, but almost solid.  It
    should come easily off of a whisk, but should be jelly-like
    in consistency.
  </p>

  <h3>Knead the Dough Thoroughly</h3>
  <p>
    Kneading the
    dough makes it more elastic, harder to rip, and easier
    to throw into a pie shape.  Also, the more you knead your
    dough, the chewier it will be when it comes out of the oven.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's pretty hard to over-knead your dough if you are doing it by hand - you'll
    tire out faster than you can ruin the dough. Kneading your
    dough ball for about 15 minutes in all should give you
    decent results.  Knead for 3-4 minutes at a time,
    letting the dough rest in between spurts for a couple
    of minutes. The dough ball should be smooth and slightly sticky
    when you are done.
  </p>

  <h3>Chill the Dough Overnight</h3>
  <p>
    If you want dough that doesn't taste like flour and nothing else,
    the single most important thing you can do is to let the yeast
    work its magic.
  </p>
  <p>
    Letting the dough sit overnight really allows the yeast enough
    time to do its magic.  Keeping it in the fridge overnight
    doesn't just keep the dough from turning into a useless hot-air balloon -
    it also slows down and changes the way the yeast eats the
    carbohydrates in the flour.
  </p>
  <p>
    While you'll have to plan a day ahead before you make pizza, you'll
    be rewarded with a much tastier crust.
  </p>

  <h3>Cook at a High Temperature
  </h3>
  <p>
    I usually cook my pizzas on the screen at the highest
    temperature an oven will go before "broil."  For my oven, that's 500&deg; F (260&deg; C).
    Cooking at a high temperature
    gets the cheese and crust cooked at a more consistent rate.  I can't quite
    put my finger on it yet, but when I cook at a lower temperature, it seems
    like the crust does not cook as fast as the toppings, and consequently
    ends up undercooked.
  </p>
  <p>
    At any rate, it is important that when you cook at a high temperature to
    preheat the oven until it is at temperature, and to open the oven door as little and
    as infrequently as possible.
